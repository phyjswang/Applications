# Introduction

This repo contains Mathematica packages I frequently use:

2. `PauliAlgebra.m` and `MatsubaraSum.m` is created by [Yizhuang You](https://github.com/EverettYou/Mathematica-for-physics).
2. `MyFunc.m`  contains many functions I defined for my own use.
3. DivergentColorMaps.m is created by [jasondbiggs](https://github.com/jasondbiggs/DivergentColorMaps)

# How to use it

1. In Mathematica, evaluate `$UserBaseDirectory`, which should gives, e.g., `~/Library/Mathematica` on MacOS.
2. Put this folder, i.e., `Applications`, in `$UserBaseDirectory`.
